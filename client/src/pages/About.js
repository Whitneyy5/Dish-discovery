              Dish Discovery is here to help you cook delicious meals with less
              stress and more joy. We offer recipes and cooking advice for home
              cooks, by home cooks. Helping create “kitchen wins” is what we are
              all about. Dish Discovery was founded in 2020 by Akeh Whitney as a
              home cooking blog to record her favorite family recipes. Today,
              Dish Discovery has grown into a trusted resource for home cooks
              with more than 3,000 tested recipes, guides, and meal plans,
              drawing over 15 million readers each month from around the world.
              We are supported by a diverse group of recipe developers, food
              writers, recipe and product testers, photographers, and other
              creative professionals. Most importantly, Dish Discovery connects
              home cooks with their greatest sources of inspiration — other home
              cooks. We're the world's leading digital food brand, and that
              inspires us to do everything possible to keep our community
              connected. Sixty-million home cooks deserve no less.

              Constructive feedback is always welcome, but rude, mean,
              disrespectful, or spammy comments are not welcome and will not be
              approved.
